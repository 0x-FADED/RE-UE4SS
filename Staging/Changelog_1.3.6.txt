New
* Mods that have 'enabled.txt' present in their mod directory are now always loaded regardless of their state in mods.txt.
* Added 'UseUObjectArrayCache' to UE4SS-settings.ini. See the ini file to more information.

Lua
* Added better support for StrProperty/FString.
  They can now be set like any other variable (Lua literal strings get auto-converted to FStrings).
  Parameters for "RegisterHook" that are of type FString are now also supported.
* Added support for SoftClassProperty/TSoftClassPtr.
* Added support for FSoftObjectPath and TSoftClassPtr, see API.txt for more information.
* The global function "RegisterHook" now returns two integers that represent pre & post callback ids.
  These ids can be passed to the "UnregisterHook" global function to unhook a function.


Fixes
* Fixed a bug that caused an occasional crash on startup.
